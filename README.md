# nodepay-bot

This repository contains code for the `nodepay-bot`, a bot designed to perform WebSocket connections through various HTTP proxies.

## Overview

The `nodepay-bot` bot establishes WebSocket connections using HTTP proxies to a specified WebSocket server. It utilizes the `ws` library for WebSocket communication and the `https-proxy-agent` library for proxy support.

## Installation

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

The `nodepay-bot` can be run using Docker or manually.

### Get your user ID

you can obtain your user ID from the nodepay website:

- Visit [https://app.nodepay.ai](https://app.nodepay.ai/register?ref=ZUCBuJaIoBXLE6J)
- Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
- Go to the "Console" tab.
- Paste the following command and press Enter:

```javascript

### Prepare proxies

You can buy proxies from [ProxyCheap](https://app.proxy-cheap.com/r/JysUiH) or any other proxy provider.

### Running the Bot with Docker (not ready)

1. Create a text file named `proxies.txt` with the desired proxy URLs. Ensure each URL is in the format:

```plaintext
http://username:password@hostname1:port
http://username:password@hostname2:port
// or
socks5://username:password@hostname1:port
socks5://username:password@hostname2:port
```

> Note: You can use HTTP or SOCKS5 proxies, and you can config with multiple proxies in the `proxies.txt` file (one proxy per line).

1. Run the `nodepay-bot` using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -v $(pwd)/proxies.txt:/app/proxies.txt -e USER_ID="your-user-id" overtrue/nodepay-bot
```

### Manual Installation
